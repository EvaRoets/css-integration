## 🎯 Objectives
- Build two full CSS integrations 

## ✔️ Specifications
- Create a standard html page based on this template for each interface:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Interface #</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Your code here -->
  </body>
</html>
```
- Create a standard `style.css` stylesheet and link it to the HTML page
- Add the relevant HTML and CSS code so that the end result looks as similar as possible to the provided _high-fidelity mockup_ images.
