## Objectives
- build two full integrations 

## Specifications
- Create a standard html page based on this template for each interface:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Interface #</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Your code here -->
  </body>
</html>
```
- Create a standard `style.css` stylesheet and link it to the HTML page
- Add the relevant HTML and CSS code so that the end result looks as similar as possible to the provided _high-fidelity mockup_ images.

### Must-haves
#### Git

- I have created the repository
- I commit regularly and with [useful commit messages](https://www.google.com/search?q=useful+commit+messages&oq=useful+commit)
- I provide a [helpful and professional README file](https://medium.com/@meakaakka/a-beginners-guide-to-writing-a-kickass-readme-7ac01da88ab3)

#### Html & CSS

- My HTML code is valid (check with an online validator), semantic and well indented
- My CSS code is valid, relevant and well indented
- The visual end result matches the challenge requirements

#### Deploy

- My work is deployed and viewable by anyone
